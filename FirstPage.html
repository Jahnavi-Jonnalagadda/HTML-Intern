<h1>HTML:Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>HTML is a standard markup language for creating Web pages and make them functional. It is the most basic building block of the web. HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another and consists of series of elements.</p>

<h2>HTML Element</h2>

<p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content and end tag. Some HTML elements have no content. These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
